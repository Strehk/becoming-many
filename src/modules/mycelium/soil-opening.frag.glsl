/*
 * Purpose: Open the ground where nothing grows on it, so the root mat reads through.
 * Context: Level 07 shows a buried system; a lawn above it must still look like a lawn.
 * Responsibility: Scale the ground's alpha between its bare and its covered value.
 * Boundary: Cords, nodes, and their own reveal stay with the Mycelium web material.
 *
 * Two values, not one. Bare earth opens far enough to read the mat through it.
 * Ground the grass field already covers stays nearly solid: the blades standing
 * on it are opaque anyway, so the cords below show only between them, which is
 * the weakened reading a lawn should give. One alpha for both would either wash
 * out the meadow or bury the open soil.
