/*
 * Purpose: Expand one instanced cord into a wobbling camera-facing ribbon envelope.
 * Context: The web renders every edge of the Connections topology in one draw call.
 * Responsibility: Bend the segmented centerline, collapse cords beyond the reveal, pass varyings.
 * Boundary: The fine filaments, knots, pulses, and the reveal mask stay in the fragment shader.
 *
 * The subdivided base strip encodes position.x as the along-cord progress and
 * position.y as the ribbon side. The ribbon is a widened invisible envelope;
 * the fragment shader draws the visible filaments inside it. Degenerate
 * instances (start equals end) collapse.
